			 <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

			 <p>Part of a sequence of courses designed to introduce students to foundational materials of western Christian historical theology, HT503 will extend from the sixteenth-century reforming traditions to the early twentieth-century dialectical theologians. </p>

			 <p>The overall objective of this course is for you to learn to express the ways in which changing political and ecclesial arrangements, changing figures of Christ, and the Bible’s reinvention of itself gave rise to various metaphors of the mirror (representing theological reflection) that moved from “the Light within” (reforming movements) to self-reflection (Post-enlightenment, modern theology), and culminated in the shattering of the illusions of self-reflection (dialectical theology). This will help you to see why some thinkers chose to pursue the “Christ of Faith,” while others chose to explore the “Jesus of History,” in order to interpret issues of Christian self-identity.</p>

			 <h2 id="structureofthecourse">Structure of the Course</h2>

			 <p>The work of the course will include one lecture, one video lecture, and one discussion group session each week; frequent one-page essays, three longer essays, and three examinations. </p>

			 <p>This work serves two broad aims. The first is that students achieve working knowledge of pivotal moments in western European Christian thought that inform the development of global Christianity. The second is that students refine their skills in reading theology and in writing; specifically, that they be able to work with primary documents, master some of the terms in the theological vocabulary of the period, and both identify and analyze arguments. These aims, along with the work of the course, are anchored in the conviction that such practices of sustained and disciplined attention are habits of mind indispensable to successful ministerial formation.</p>

			 <h3 id="participation">Participation</h3>

			 <p>Class participation (i.e., regular attendance at lectures and discussion groups, timely completion of assignments, and constructive contribution to discussion) will count toward a portion of your grade. Regular, active, conscientious participation in class can tip the balance upward, while indifferent participation can tip it downward.</p>

			 <h3 id="videolectures">Video Lectures</h3>

			 <p>Video lectures can be found in Blackboard, under Videos. Echo360 is a video application fully integrated into Blackboard, through which you may view the video lectures. Please also note that the video lectures are NOT a supplement to the live lectures but rather cover entirely different material. If you do not take the time to listen and take notes from the video lectures, you will miss half of the course.</p>

			 <h3 id="discussiongroups">Discussion Groups</h3>

			 <p>Discussion groups will focus upon primary document analysis, with specific attention to Graff and Birkenstein, <em>They Say, I Say</em>. </p>

			 <h3 id="examinations">Examinations</h3>

			 <p>Two of the three in-class examinations will occur within the course of the semester (February 18 and March 25); the final examination will take place during exam week at the end of the semester (TBA). </p>

			 <h3 id="essays">Essays</h3>

			 <p>To develop your understanding and comprehension of the course materials, we will maintain a strong emphasis upon writing. As writing is one of the best aids to learning, we will ask you to pursue two related practices. </p>

			 <p>The first practice is weekly preparation of a one-to-two page, four-to-six paragraph paper that addresses the specific question we have posed. These comparative questions you are to address draw upon the readings, the lecture material, and the artwork. Essays are due via email and Blackboard on Friday at midnight. Discussion group sessions will assist you in developing your ability to identify the arguments in the primary readings. We encourage you to write a preliminary essay on each of the documents prior to composing each comparative essay. This will make it easier to draw clear comparisons among the primary documents in question. </p>

			 <p>The second practice is the preparation of a significant essay of eight to ten pages. You will do so in three stages over the course of the semester. The first stage or essay will focus on a core theocentric (self-knowledge and knowledge of God) or Christocentric (justification by faith) idea. The second stage or essay will expand upon the first, incorporating a comparative dimension. The third and final stage (essay) will bring a critical assessment into the body of this comparative essay. You will receive extensive comments on the first two essays (due February 14 and April 1) to help you in the preparation of your final draft (due April 24). </p>

			 <p>We will not assign a grade to the weekly essays, but we will comment on them. In this way, we hope to assist you in your creation of a notebook of written responses to the learning objectives in this course. The questions for each session link together primary sources, art, and lecture material. Together with the notes you prepare to answer the other learning objectives, these materials will provide you with a foundation for the in-class exams and for writing the three longer essays. Or better: they are ways of developing your capacities to compare and contrast differing theological orientations and commitments, which will be a basic component of our assessments of your work. Growth in this capacity occurs through repetition over time. For this reason, we will insist that papers be turned in on their due date. We will not accept late papers or grant extensions. </p>

			 <h4 id="papersubmission">Paper Submission</h4>

			 <p>Weekly essays should be submitted via email ( ht503essays@gmail.com) AND via Blackboard by midnight on Friday. Your discussion group leader may assign a third form of submission. Longer essays should be submitted via email (ht503essays@gmail.com) and Blackboard prior to class time and AND in hard copy in class or at discussion group. </p>

			 <h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>

			 <h3 id="readings">Readings</h3>

			 <p>Primary documents for this course, compiled by the historical studies faculty, will be available on CourseReserves. Links to CourseReserves are available on the Emory home page, at ht.walgan.us, and on Blackboard.</p>

			 <p>You will also find the following secondary resources significantly helpful for your work in this course: Graff and Birkenstein, <em>They Say, I Say: The moves that Matter in Academic Writing</em> (New York: W.W. Norton, 2010); Darmaid McCulloch, <em>Christianity: The First Three Thousand Years</em>; Martin Marty, <em>The Christian World: A Global History</em> (New York: Modern Library, 2008). If you have never read the short book on <em>The Elements of Style</em> by William Strunk, Jr., and E. B. White, we encourage you to read it this term. You will find it wonderfully helpful with your writing. We also strongly encourage you to make use of the <em>Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church</em>.</p>

			 <p>We are also asking you to read portions of David S. Pacini, <em>Through Narcissus’ Glass Darkly</em> (New York, New York: Fordham Univ. Press, 2008) which will be invaluable to you in answering essay and test questions.</p>

			 <h3 id="slidestimelineandothersupplementalmaterials">Slides, Timeline, and Other Supplemental Materials</h3>

			 <p>These will be available online at ht.walgan.us. </p>

			 <h3 id="audiorecordings">Audio Recordings</h3>

			 <p>Audio recordings of the in-class lectures can be found on Emory University iTunes. Go to itunes.emory.edu and click on the link titled “Exclusively Emory.” This link will require you to enter your Emory login ID and password. Once you’ve logged in, the page should automatically cue up your iTunes program. </p>

			 <h3 id="blackboard">Blackboard</h3>

			 <p>You can find links to the aforementioned course resources and places to submit your essays on Blackboard.</p>

			 <p>We encourage you to make use of Blackboard’s linguistic analysis capabilities in SafeAssign. The ability to put ideas in your own words is one of the building blocks of clear writing. SafeAssign will identify the extent to which you rely upon other person’s words, signaling areas in your writing that might be improved. Be sure to test-drive Blackboard as soon as possible, and to allow time after finishing your paper to correct or work around any technical problems you might encounter. Computer problems will not constitute grounds for changing the no-late-work policy. </p>

			 <h2 id="groundrules">Ground Rules</h2>

			 <h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>

			 <p>We prefer and strongly encourage you to contact your group leader or the teaching team at ht503essays@gmail.com with any questions or comments. We will do our best to respond to email within two days. If you have not received a response after that time, please send it again or contact us by other means. </p>

			 <h3 id="screens">Screens</h3>

			 <p>Although laptops and tablets are permitted in class (as long as students agree that their computers are for note taking and document reading only), we strongly discourage the practice. A recent study suggests (1 that screens in lecture classes may make for poorer attending and learning, and (2 that screens may be more distracting to students who did not bring screens than to the students who did. If you must use laptops or tablets, please refrain from ALL internet activities during class. Please read our community covenant on this matter which is posted on our Blackboard site. </p>

			 <h3 id="honorcodeplagiarism">Honor Code &amp; Plagiarism</h3>

			 <p>In all proceedings of the course, students will conduct themselves entirely in conformity with the policies of the Candler Academic Honor Code. The honor code appears on pages 99 to 103 of the 2013&#8211;2014 Candler Catalogue.</p>

			 <p>Because several students in recent years have misunderstood the rule on plagiarism, the faculty has voted that each course syllabus should contain the school&#8217;s plagiarism statement: &#8220;Plagiarism is the act of presenting as one&#8217;s own work as the work of another person whether published or unpublished (including the work of another student). A writer&#8217;s work should be regarded as his or her own property. Any person who knowingly uses a writer&#8217;s distinctive work without proper acknowledgment is guilty of plagiarism.&#8221; Use of work completed in previous courses or submitting the same paper in two different courses are instances of plagiarism. Since plagiarism is a serious offense in a university, we would invite any student who might have a question about the policy to ask us about it. We also recommend to you the Emory College statement on plagiarism, which many students have found instructive. </p>

			 <p>Please note that the published guidelines around self-plagiarism are especially vague. Your midterm and final essays will treat topics covered in previous writing assignments. We hope that in rewriting you will rethink and come to a better understanding of the topics on which you have already written. You may not reuse work you have already submitted in another course. </p>

			 <h3 id="disabilityservices">Disability Services</h3>

			 <p>Accommodations for students registered with the Office of Disability Services are effective immediately upon receipt of the accommodation letter. Students and the teaching team will work together to clarify the parameters of these accommodations within days of the letter’s presentation. </p>
